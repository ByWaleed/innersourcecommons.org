The most important difference is probably in their budgets: as potential profit centers, API products can afford to invest a lot more money in documentation and UX driven developer portal improvements. Internal APIs rarely have that luxury. In this talk I will explain the differences between public and private APIs, introduce upstream developer experience, and explain how it can improve downstream DX. Introduce experience design (a.k.a. gamification), and describe how it could be used on internal developer portals. Lastly I will talk about the importance of SDKs and the different strategies an organisation can take to build them, including an innersourcing strategy that could help to improve the DX of APIs at the heart of your organisation&rsquo;s digital transformation initiative.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=author><a href=/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#georg_gruetter>Georg Grütter <span class=affiliation>(Robert Bosch)</span></td><td class=title>Bosch Internal Open Source - Empowering Fellow Engineers with APIs

So far we collected development activity information from over 450,000 open source projects to quantify their performance and predict their success.

To better understand IS, researchers and practitioners need to measure IS collaboration. However, there is no established method yet for doing so. In this talk, we present a method for measuring IS collaboration by measuring the patch-flow within an organization. Patch-flow is the flow of code contributions across organizational boundaries such as project, organizational unit, or profit center boundaries. We demonstrate the capability of the patch-flow measurement method by applying it at a software developing company. In this company, we found that about half (47.9%) of all code contributions to IS projects constitute patch-flow between organizational units, almost all (42.2%) being between organizational units working on different products. Such significant patch-flow indicates high relevance of the patch-flow phenomenon. Our patch-flow measurement method is the first of its kind to measure and quantify IS collaboration. It can serve as a base for further quantitative analyses of IS collaboration.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>17:30 - 17:45</td><td colspan=2>Closing</td></tr><tr><td class=time>19:00 - 22:00</td><td colspan=2>Social Event</td></tr></table><table class="schedule table table-striped"><tr><td colspan=3><h3>Thursday, May 17th</h3></td></tr><tr><td class=time>09:00 - 09:15</td><td colspan=2>Opening</td></tr><tr><td class=time>09:15 - 10:00</td><td class=author><a href=/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#lauri_apple>Lauri Apple</a> <span class=affiliation>Workday</span></td><td class=title><span class=keynoteTag>Keynote:</span> Building Trust with Intentional Relationship Design

One of them being internal tooling were we think InnerSource is quite a natural fit. Thanks to our constant efforts of pushing BIOS forward over the last nine years we're finally able to convince the corporate sector IT at Bosch to start the adoption of InnerSource. The first internal tool which will become a BIOS project is the so-called Open Source Desktop (OSD), a Linux based OS altenative for Bosch associates. Apart from providing details on the first steps we took, we will also give some insights on the preconditions which are key for a successful InnerSource project and give a brief overview about the areas where OSD is used within Bosch.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>11:00 - 12:00</td><td><a href=/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#erin_bank>Erin Bank</a> <span class=affiliation>(CA Technologies)</span></td><td class=title>InnerSource Patterns (Part 2): Together we can build the roadmap for success!

When adopting inner source by founding a new inner source program, or even when managing the evolution of an existing initiative, it is crucial to understand what different shapes (classes) of inner source projects and programs exist. In this talk, we present a classification framework laying out different classes of inner source projects and programs. We apply the framework to eleven companies doing IS and discuss differences of their inner source programs. The presented classification framework is the first of its kind to classify and structure the space of existing inner source program.

Perhaps open source is one of the most paradigmatic cases: with innovative practices, we have seen how globally distributed teams, mixtures of paid and volunteer developers, reusing tens of pieces of code, have been consistently delivering high quality software. What can data science learn from Software Engineering and Open Source?

Many go a step further and even start to measure metrics about its effectiveness. Metrics are tricky though, they often just frustrate developers, are easy to game and very rarely tie back to anything the business understands - cyclomatic complexity and KLOC anyone? This talk will propose some metrics used by a venture capital fund that manages companies like Docker, Twitter, Blabla Car and Hello Fresh to measure the success of their investments. We will show the economic impact of those metrics on concrete examples of their application at large companies like Allianz, Continental and Zalando. As many of those metrics have to do with the application of inner source (open source in the boundaries of enterprises), we will also demystify the probably greatest misperception about inner source which is hampering especially middle management to adopt it – the fear that every developer from now on just does whatever he or she wants.</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>15:45 - 16:30</td><td class=author><a href=/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#russel_rutledge>Russ Rutledge</a> <span class=affiliation>(Nike)</span></td><td class=title>An Oriole for InnerSource

As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.</p><h3 id=what-is-the-innersource-commons>What is the InnerSource Commons?</h3><p>The InnerSource Commons (<a href=http://innersourcecommons.org>InnerSourceCommons.org</a>) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over sixty companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule>Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p><h3 id=who-should-attend>Who should attend?</h3><p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up.
