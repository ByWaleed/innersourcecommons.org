<p>The InnerSource Commons (<a href="http://innersourcecommons.org">InnerSourceCommons.org</a>) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-conductaboutcodeofconduct"><a href="/about/codeofconduct/">Code of Conduct</a></h3>
<p>All participants, vendors, and guests at InnerSource Commons events are required to abide by the <a href="/about/codeofconduct/">code of conduct</a>.</p>
<p>All related conversations in the InnerSource Slack Channel will still be considered to fall under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule">Chatham House Rules</a>: information discussed can be shared but not attributed.</p>
