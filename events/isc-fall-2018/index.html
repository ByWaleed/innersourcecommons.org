Many engineers lack the background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development.

It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples.

This talk is about the 9-month journey I’ve had since the beginning of the year. During this time, I’ve encountered people all over our global organization. Most of them are overwhelmingly positive about this concept of InnerSource. Fortunately, I’m in an environment where it’s not only supported by upper management but being actively encouraged. At the ISC Spring Summit, I met several people who were interested in starting up an InnerSource program, but not sure what to do first.
