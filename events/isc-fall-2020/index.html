In this session, we will share our experiences on applying InnerSourceCommons patterns and the unexpected synergies along the way.

(a) How can we efficiently crawl InnerSource projects from various sources and merge them into one source? Projects may be located in GitHub Enterprise, Git/Gerrit, or ABAP systems,
(b) In which order shall we present the results? Is there a way to show the most active and promising projects to the community first? How can we automatically measure and track the activity of an InnerSource project?,
(c) Which metadata should be provided by project owners to list skills and needs for potential contributors? How can they be presented in the Project Portal?<br>We solved them the InnerSource way:
With creative collaboration across organizational borders and by sharing our experiences with the InnerSourceCommons community. We ended up with two new InnerSource projects and a backlog of new ideas. As a side-project we even drafted a new pattern to rank InnerSource projects - the InnerSource Activity Score</div></td></tr><tr><td class=time>11:50 - 12:05</td><td class=author><b><a href=/events/isc-fall-2020-speakers#joe_chavez>Joe Chavez</a></b> (Cognitive Software Services)</td><td class=title>InnerSource in Government: our 18 month journey

The new world that we&rsquo;ve awoken to is now one of continous connection. In this keynote, Diane Mueller will discuss how to leverage these new connected strategies, emerging trends towards &lsquo;virtuous&rsquo; cycle of collaboration between end users, vendors, enterprises and open source initiatives that has emerged as a result, and how to bring this new model and strategies, values and ways of connecting and collaborating both internally (InnerSource), externally (Open Source) to your organizations' development efforts.</div></td></tr></p><tr><td class=time>12:25 - 12:35</td><td colspan=2>Wrap Up: Summit Summary, Highlights, and next Summit news!</td></tr></table><h3 id=registration>Registration</h3><p><a href=https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/innersource-commons-fall-2020-virtual-summit-tickets-117435975163>Click here to register</a> for the InnerSource Commons Fall 2020 Virtual Summit.

It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule>Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p><h3 id=who-should-attend>Who should attend?</h3><p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.</p><h3 id=what-will-i-get-from-this-event>What will I get from this event?</h3><p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:</p><ul><li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption</li><li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges</li><li>Network, network, network!
