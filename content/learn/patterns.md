Over many years the InnerSource Commons has collected best practices around InnerSource, codified in a specific format to make it easy to understand, evaluate, and apply them in your context.  We call this format a **pattern**.

We hold infrequent office-hours to discuss anything related to patterns. Most of the work is however done asynchronously in the <a href="https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns/" target="_blank">InnerSourcePatterns GitHub repository</a>.

## InnerSource Patterns Book

<a href="/learn/books/innersource-patterns/">
  <img src="/images/learn/books/innersource-patterns-book-cover-thumb.jpg" class="img-fluid w-25 rounded float-left mr-4 clearfix">

Our <a href="/learn/books/innersource-patterns/">InnerSource Patterns Book</a> contains the most mature patterns, each pattern reviewed by members of the community and with at least one known instance of pattern use.

Patterns can provide a way for the InnerSource Commons participants to concisely share information, improving the practice of InnerSource. Patterns are divided into Title, Problem Statement, Context, Forces, and Solutions as their main sections.

If you are using InnerSource in your company already and want to contribute your experiences to this book, we would love to <a href="https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns/appendix/contribute-to-this-book">welcome your contributions</a>!
