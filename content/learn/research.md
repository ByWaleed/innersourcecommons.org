The research community has been a strong ally of the InnerSource Commons ever since it was founded. The researchers have taken great interest in learning more about how companies are applying InnerSource. Their discoveries have greatly improved our collective understanding of how InnerSource helps companies to improve.

## [State of InnerSource 2020](/documents/surveys/State.of.InnerSource.Report.2020.pdf)

The 2020 State of the InnerSource Survey was conducted as a checkpoint to assess how the InnerSource community is shaping up, what we have been doing right, and what aspects need improvement.

The goal of the survey was to address three main questions:

1. What is the state of InnerSource adoption across different organizations?
2. What factors influence the success of InnerSource adoption?
3. What are the main obstacles for adopting InnerSource?

Since a number of studies already documented the Key Factors for InnerSource success in detail, we focused more on exploring the key motivations for contributors and the obstacles.

### Results

For the full results see the [State of InnerSource 2020 Report](/documents/surveys/State.of.InnerSource.Report.2020.pdf).

### Authors

This survey was conducted by Tapajit Dey of Lero—the Irish Software Research Centre. Cristina Coffey and Tadhg O’Neill of InnerSource Commons contributed to the report outline and design.

## [State of InnerSource 2016](/documents/surveys/InnerSourceCommonsSurvey2016.pdf)

The goal of this First Annual State of InnerSource Commons survey was to establish a first baseline of how organizations adopt InnerSource. The survey addresses many aspects, including development methods, practices, quality assurance, tools, and motivation and organizational support.

### Results

### Authors

This survey was conducted by Dr. Klaas-Jan Stol of Lero—the Irish Software Research Centre, and Dr. Tim Yao of Nokia. Dr. Bora Caglayan of Lero contributed to the survey design.
