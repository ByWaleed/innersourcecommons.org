          <p>The InnerSource Commons utilizes open source methods to provide organizations practicing InnerSource a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>

        <p class="section-title h2">InnerSource Commons Members</p>
        <p>The InnerSource Commons community is open to all. Some community participants go above and beyond, and may be invited to become an ISC Member. The InnerSource Commons is aÂ membership corporation, so ISC Members serve a similar role as shareholders do in publicly traded corporations. Members have particular rights in the ISC, for example they may vote in board elections. To be eligible for Membership, a person must be nominated by a current Member. Membership is purely merit-based, free of any cost, and restricted to individuals.
