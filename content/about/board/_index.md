{{< board-member name="Cedric Williams" title="Treasurer" image="/images/about/Cedric_Williams.jpg" style="bg-light" >}}
All of Cedric’s work, personal and professional, has been guided by my desire to improve people's lives - mostly through technology. The possibilities that can be unlocked with software and hardware systems are literally limitless. Each of his engagements has been given me the opportunity to work on that in new ways, some more technology-focused, and some more focused directly on customers. All of them have given him a deep appreciation for the responsibility of technologists to always make sure that what we build makes things better for anyone involved.
