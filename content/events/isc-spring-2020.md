### 14th to 15th April 2020, online

The 10th InnerSource Commons Summit took place in *your living room*! ;) We went virtual - see details below. All the summit talks are now available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCH-i0B0otNQeYBH5QvNRBDA3CMrS9lL9">InnerSource Commons YouTube channel</a>!

### The following information is for reference purposes only.

We are all exploring new ways to get together and keep advancing in the body of knowledge of InnerSource. Nowadays and in this industry, it is more and more important to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This online event has this in mind and we hope to learn from each other, what it is working and what it is not.

These two days will be a three hours slot taking place from 4 pm CET till 7 pm Central European Time, / 9 am and noon Central Time / 7 am and 10 am Pacific Time / 10 pm and 1 am China Standard Time.

The day will be split as a sandwich, where talks will be the bread and discussions the _yummi yummi_ part. We are expecting to have two keynotes per day (up to 25 minutes each), and four lightning talks (up to 15 minutes each). These will be initially pre-recorded and discussions will take place in the InnerSource Commons Slack. Right in the middle we will have a break and two breakout sessions with live interactions.

We're planning to have a contest as well as icebreaker during the first moments of this, do not miss this! 

### COVID-19 and InnerSource Commons current Status

As of now, the InnerSource Commons Madrid Summit is taking place.
However, not in Madrid, Spain.

The current situation as you all know has quickly evolved and we all need to be socially responsible.
Our first priority is the safety of everyone and we have decided to celebrate the April meeting as a *virtual* meeting where we all can keep collaborating, and learning from each other.

If you have already registered and paid for the ticket entry, you have several options:
* We do a refunding as soon as we get notified by you.
* You are still interested in participating. For this, we would like to ask you to support the InnerSource Commons. We ask for a small fee and you will get a t-shirt and some stickers.
* If you already bought a ticket with the higher fee, you can donate the difference of ~20EUR to the InnerSource Commons. In this case: Thank you!
* If you already bought a ticket with the higher fee, you can also get a partial refund of the difference.

### Notes

The following agenda is based in **Central European Time** and this will take place between 3:50 pm and 7:05 pm (3.25 hours in total). Both days, 14th and 15th of April will use the timeslot. By the time of the conference, the following are some examples of translated times to other timezones:

Example of time differences in other timezones for the first day of conference:
* China Standard Time: 09:50 pm 14th April - 01:05 am 15th April
* Coordinated Universal Time: 1:50 pm - 5:05 pm 14th April
* Eastern Time: 09:50 am - 1:05 pm 14th April
* Pacific Time: 6:50 am - 10:05 am 14th April

In a multinational software corporation like SAP, that has recently grown to almost a hundred thousand employees, reuse and efficient collaboration across organizational borders is quite a challenge. Our development organization spreads across the globe and our products are implemented on a large variety of technology stacks. How can we establish an efficient development process and a collaboration culture at the same time? 

As we transform into a cloud company, we leverage open standards and open source components in our products. We also create technology frameworks and tools that we share with the community. Also, we are a strong and diverse community of developers inside the company. Collaboration happens quite naturally because we identify synergies or have a similar challenge to solve – sometimes without knowing that we are doing InnerSource.

On larger scale, InnerSource establishes well-aligned architectures, maximizes reuse, and avoids organizational silos. It allows to share not only code, but also architectural patterns, data models, learning material, knowledge and experiences, as well as documentation across organizational borders. And it can also be an incubator for open source. Therefore, it is important to promote and facilitate the adoption of InnerSource across the company. 

Along practical examples, we share our journey towards InnerSource and how we are growing a collaboration culture based on open source methodology in our development organization.

The modern IT consists of constant transformations, product and feature teams, a large number of engineers, plenty of new roles and many business units that solve similar business cases every day. The complexity of business requires modern approaches in development and mature engineering culture. The choice to adopt InnerSource can cover most of the business needs. Usually, InnerSource adoption grows from a small experimental team. But what if to roll these principles to all teams and companies in the group at once? This talk will show our experience and key findings after one year of movement.

In this talk, we'll explore topics crucial to Inner Source culture, including:
    (a) whether your organisation's current cultural values and established beliefs are a good fit for the ways of working required for Inner Source; 
    (b) how to get more employees to collaborate on Inner Source projects that are not part of their specific responsibility; 
    (c) using perceived negative cultural traits such as competitiveness and control to your advantage.

This session offers an opportunity to participate in the conversation by asking your own questions about Inner Source culture, sharing insights and experiences, hearing what's worked well for other organisations, and getting to know others in Inner Source. Dive in and join the conversation, or just sit back, observe, and listen.

InnerSource adoption in your organization cannot happen magically by itself. Fear not! There are proven best practices you can follow to adopt InnerSource and run a successful program at your company. In the InnerSource Commons, we document such best practices in the form of InnerSource patterns. A pattern is a structured description of a repeatable and proven solution to a specific problem. This talk introduces the concept and format of patterns, presents a selection of the current (and growing) set of InnerSource patterns, and enables you to formulate best practices you know in the pattern format.
During the breakout groups following this talk, we are certain you can apply your new knowledge on patterns: If you are discussing a solution to a common problem, why not formulate it as a pattern and submit it to github.com/innersourcecommons/innersourcepatterns?

Digital transformation is the process through which organizations learn to break free from over-complicated constraints and learn to accept and leverage their internal complexity. Many technologies and methodologies exist that contribute to that transformation, but individually they often fail to deliver a true transformation. InnerSourcing can play a key role in interlinking these strategies and the people that execute them to help companies to catalyze a phase change in an organization's behavior. In this talk I will discuss 5 objectives that help companies become complex adaptive systems, and how Innersourcing initiatives can contribute to them.

This case study will start with the background of the problem. How did the BBC end up with a monolithic client that was a huge source of FUD for developers working on it? What sort of problems were they facing day by day when developing on it? What could be done to alleviate the FUD of working on this client, and re-enable innovation and rapid development in their products?

InnerSource and open source share common roots and are based on the same fundamental ideas, but they're not the same. Georg Grütter sheds light on the differences and makes a case for why both have a place in the world of software development.

Open source has been around for a long time now. Its success has led to and lends credibility to the growing practice of InnerSource. Despite being around for over 15 years, there are still a lot of misconceptions about InnerSource, many of which revolve around its relation to open source.

Georg Grütter examines the main differences between InnerSource and open source and discusses if InnerSource even has a place in a world in which open source is becoming more and more prevalent. You’ll explore if InnerSource creates more problems than it solves and if all InnerSource initiatives will eventually lead to open source, anyway. Georg explains how an open source practice differs from an InnerSource practice, all to make a case for InnerSource in an open source-dominated world.

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
  
### Who should attend?

The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.
   
### What will I get from this event?

The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
