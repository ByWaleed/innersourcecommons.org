Join us at the world's largest InnerSource Conference! 

InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. The InnerSource Commons (ISC) is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners, who have come together with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource. You can join the community at www.innersourcecommons.org.

We come together at our summits to learn and share experiences. We've missed seeing everyone in person over the past 2 years, but we are looking forward to seeing everyone online at this year's virtual summit. Join us there to...

- Hear about global trends in InnerSource.

- Share your own experience and meet like-minded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success within their respective organizations.

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
