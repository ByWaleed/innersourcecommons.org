### Call for Presenters Now Open!
#### Deadline September 30th, 2021

The call for presenters is now open. To submit a proposal for the InnerSource Summit 2021 please complete the [Call for Proposal form](https://forms.gle/pQFor7XMECbq1CXL7). All proposals are due by midnight (anywhere on earth), September 30th, 2021. Speakers will be notified if they are successful by October 14th, 2021. 

Although we usually operate under Chatham House Rules at our physical events, because this summit will be virtual, all presentations will be public and 10 to 15 minutes long. 

Sessions will be pre-recorded and streamed, and speakers are asked to be available for live Q&A chat during the streaming of their session. 

We are accepting session proposals in English as well as other languages. If you would prefer to present in a language other than English - please let us know in the form. 

Deadline for submitting recordings will be November 3rd. The ISC Summit Team will be available to help facilitate recordings. 

With your permission, summit sessions will be  shared after the event. All chats/discussions will remain under Chatham House Rules. See https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule for more information.



### Save the dates: 17th and 18th November 2021, online

Join us at the world's largest InnerSource Conference!

Given the ongoing uncertainties for international travel, the 2021 InnerSource Summit will again be held online. Nowadays, particularly in our industry, it is more important than ever to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This year's InnerSource Summit will encourage learning and sharing experiences in online environments that facilitate our remote work. 

We are looking forward to meeting and learning from each other, what it is working and what it is not.



### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.


### [Code of Conduct](/about/codeofconduct/)

All participants, vendors, and guests at InnerSource Commons events are required to abide by the [code of conduct](/about/codeofconduct/).

All related conversations in the InnerSource Slack Channel will still be considered to fall under [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): information discussed can be shared but not attributed.

Interested in getting involved? Email <summit@innersourcecommons.org> or join the conversation on the [#innersourcecommons](https://innersourcecommons-inviter.herokuapp.com/) slack channel!
